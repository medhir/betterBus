## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

First, install the following if you don't already have them installed.

```
npm install -g cordova ionic      // installs ionic framework and cordova dependency
npm install -g bower              // installs bower globally
npm install -g gulp               // installs gulp globally
npm install -g jasmine            // installs jasmine globally
npm install -g jasmine-node       // (if using our server repo) installs jasmine-node globally
```

Next, run the following commands to install all the required dependencies.

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Transit Data Api

For our transit data, we are relying on the nextbus api. Since nextbus only publishes this data as an XML feed, we are
using the [restbus library](http://restbus.info/) (a rest abstraction over the nextbus xml feed). Feel free to [fork
our api](https://github.com/inverted-murmuration/api) server or roll your own using the 
[restbus library](http://restbus.info/). 

### Server for authentication & other services (optional)

We've also set up a node server with a postgres database to use for user authentication and any other services you'd 
like to add in the future. Feel free to [fork it](https://github.com/inverted-murmuration/server). We used the sequelize
ORM to interact with our postgres database. To easily install postgres on your local machine, take a look at the 
[Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/).

## Deployment & Continuous Integration

### Set up deployment environment

For easy deployment and integration with Travis CI (see below), consider using Heroku for deployment. If you are not
familiar with Heroku, check out their [Getting Started with Node.js] guide.
(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)

Note: if you are using our server repo and would like to add a postgres database service hosted on heroku, make sure
you add your postgres server as an addon in the resources page of your heroku server. If you try to add a postgres
service from the databases section of your heroku dashboard, heroku will spin up a new server for this postgres service
which won't be accessible from your original server.

### Set up continuous integration

We are using Travis Ci. For this report there is no automated deployment. However, npm test is run on Travis Ci every time a pull request is submitted and when a pull request is merged into the master branch. After you fork a copy of this repo, you will need to setup your own Travis account. 

1. Visit https://travis-ci.org and create an account.
1. Open your Organization inside Travis Ci
  1. Sync your Organization
  1. Turn on your newly forked repository
1. Verify Permissions 
  1. Visit https://github.com/<your Organization name>
    1. Click Organization settings
    1. Click Third-party access
    1. Verify Travis Ci is Approved
  1. Visit https://github.com/<your Organization name>/<your project name>/settings/hooks
    1. Verify Travis Ci is an added Service
1. Update the first line of this document to follow this format

```

## Testing

While developing, try using the

```
ionic serve --lab
```

command to test the app in your browser

We've installed a number of testing suites for you to use as you wish. These include:

### Unit tests - Jasmine / Karma 

The unit test spec files can be found at www/spec/unit. To run these tests (as well as jshint), run the following in
your terminal window from the project root directory.

```
npm test
```

### e2e tests - Protractor

The end-to-end test spec files can be found at www/spec/e2e. To run these tests, run the following the the terminal from
the project root directory.

```
gulp protractor
```
